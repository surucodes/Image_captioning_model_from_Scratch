# Image_captioning_model_from_Scratch
VisionSpeak: Image Captioning with Deep Learning  Designed and implemented an image captioning system from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras in Google Colab, integrating a CNN-LSTM architecture to generate natural language descriptions for images. Leveraged Xception for transfer learning to extract image features and an LSTM with embeddings .
